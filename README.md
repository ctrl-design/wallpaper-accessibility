# Wallpaper Accessibility
A template image for design teams showing an opinionated 'best' location for wallpaper text and features to enhance readability

## Resolutions

- 1280 x 1024
- 1440 x 900
- 1920 x 1080

# Assumptions

1. Left-to-right Language
2. Shortcut label text colour is white (Windows default)
3. Taskbar is primarily along the bottom of the screen, though may be on the left or top
4. Wallpaper is centered on-screen
5. Information is hard to read when covered by shortcuts

# Justification

1. Desktop shortcuts accumulate from the top-left, either downward or to the right
2. Essential information should be on-screen regardless of the operating resolution
3. Information should be located in the least likely location to be covered by shortcuts

# Conclusion

On a 1920px height by 1080px width canvas.

## Essential Information
Essential information should be inside a 640px width by 400px height box bound by the coordinates 960x 550y and 1600x 950y.

## Aesthetic Features
Aesthetic features should extend from the essential bounding box down and to the right.
